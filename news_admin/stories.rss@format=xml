It is likely to head towards West Bengal and Odisha coasts. </p><p>Warning the fishermen to not venture into the sea from May 24 as the sea condition will be rough to very rough, the IMD issued a notice stating that a low pressure area is very likely to form over North Andaman Sea and adjoining East Central Bay of Bengal around May 22, which is likely to intensify gradually into a Cyclonic Storm by May 25 and is also likely to move northwestwards and reach West Bengal – Odisha coasts around May 26 evening.</p><p>“Squally wind speed reaching 45–55 kmph gusting to 65 kmph is likely to prevail over Andaman Sea &amp; adjoining East-central Bay of Bengal on May 23. It is very likely to increase from 50–60 kmph gusting to 70 kmph from May 23. It will be stronger post May 24,” read the statement of IMD.</p><p>Regional Meteorological Department director GK Das said that post May 23 if the low pressure over central Bay of Bengal turns into cyclone then it might bring moderate to heavy rainfall not just in coastal areas of West Bengal but entire South Bengal might witness torrential rainfall.</p><p>“There is a favourable chance that the low pressure might convert into cyclone and if it turns into cyclone then after sporadic rainfall from May 23, gradually the amount of rainfall might increase in South Bengal,” said Das adding that there is a chance that monsoon will enter Kerala and then West Bengal ahead of the scheduled timings.</p><p>Meanwhile, West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee on Wednesday had asked all the District Magistrates to take necessary actions ahead of time so that no untoward incidents happen during the cyclone.</p><p>Notably, last year amidst lockdown super cyclone Amphan had brought in very severe rainfall to West Bengal including Kolkata and had damaged several constructions in the Sundarban area. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Madhya Pradesh: Unlocking process to begin from June 1; Know all things here </title><link>https://www.freepressjournal.in/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-unlocking-process-to-begin-from-june-1-know-all-things-here</link><comments>https://www.freepressjournal.in/bhopal/madhya-pradesh-unlocking-process-to-begin-from-june-1-know-all-things-here#comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">344d0229-a1f4-4bde-8f8a-f2788cc378e1</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 17:23:49 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2021-05-19T17:23:49.304Z</atom:updated><atom:author><atom:name>Staff Reporter</atom:name><atom:uri>/api/author/623880</atom:uri></atom:author><description></description><media:keywords>COVID cases in MP,Unlock in MP from June,Unlock in MP</media:keywords><media:content height="2530" url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/32d4d609-2333-4585-86a7-5c93160ef621/7pic18.jpg" width="4311"><media:title type="html"></media:title></media:content><media:thumbnail url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/32d4d609-2333-4585-86a7-5c93160ef621/7pic18.jpg?w=280" width="280"></media:thumbnail><category>Bhopal</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><strong>BHOPAL:</strong> Chief Minister Shivraj Singh Chouhan has said that the process for unlocking will begin from June 1.</p><p>Chouhan made the statement at a meeting to review the situation arising out of Covid-19 in Ujjain division on Wednesday.</p><p>Unlocking will gradually begin in the districts, he has said, adding that everything will be back to normal from the next month, but the people have to follow the corona curfew rules till May 31.</p><p>There should not be any relaxation in that, he says.</p><p>The corona curfew began from the first week of April.

Or a tie? Or worse, a washout? The Indian cricket team is eagerly awaiting a response to this and other questions concerning the Playing Conditions for the marquee clash in Southampton from June 18 to 22.</em></p><p><em>The International Cricket Council (ICC) is expected to release the Playing Conditions in the coming days.</em></p><p><em>"Since this is not another bilateral series Test match, we need to know about the playing conditions. There are three basic pointers that we need to know," according to a senior BCCI official.</em></p><p><em>"What happens in case of a draw, tie or an eventual wash-out without at least one innings of both teams not being completed," he added.</em></p><p><em>"The ICC will be publishing the Playing Conditions in coming days. We can't put a date but I believe they will send it soon."</em></p><p><em>Meanwhile, the Indian team, after reaching London, early next month is expected to leave immediately for Southampton where it will be in quarantine during the England versus New Zealand Test match at the Ageas Bowl.</em></p><p><em>"Yes, India will be in Southampton only when New Zealand and England play the first of their two Tests. We expect ICC to give an idea of the duration of hard or soft quarantine in the next few days.</em></p><p><em>"Since it's an ICC event, the final notification needs to come from them," the source said.</em></p><p><em>The Indian team is hoping to train during its soft quarantine but negotiations are still on with regards to duration of quarantine.</em></p><p><em>While the likes of Mayank Agarwal, Ravichandran Ashwin, bowling coach Bharat Arun on Wednesday arrived in Mumbai on a charter flight from Chennai, Mohammed Siraj, men's team fielding coach R Sridhar, women's Test and ODI captain Mithali Raj will all be boarding from Hyderabad.</em></p><p><em>However, all those living in Mumbai, Pune and adjoining areas can join the team bubble on May 24 like men's team skipper Virat Kohli, his respective red and white ball deputies Ajinkya Rahane and Rohit Sharma, and women's team batter Jemimah Rodrigues.</em></p><p><em>Even KL Rahul, who is recovering from an appendicitis operation is in Mumbai is expected to join the bubble on May 24.</em></p><p><em>BCCI has deployed three charter flights, from Delhi, Hyderabad and Chennai, for both male and female cricketers. All those who are not in these three metro cities are supposed to take a private car and reach the destinations for their respective flights.</em></p><p><em>A few who wanted to fly commercial with their negative reports have been allowed.</em></p><p><em>"Also the rule for boarding a charter flight is that even the driver of the private car needs to quarantine three days before the journey and have a negative RT-PCR report.</em></p><p><em>"There was no reason for this clarification but when former players, who have played at the highest level, amplify rumours on social media, you are left with no choice," a senior official said.</em></p><p><em>"Each and every member of the men's and women's team are aware of travel details," he added.</em></p><p><em>All players, irrespective of whether they are entering on Wednesday or next Monday, are expected to carry three RT-PCR negative results and there will be three more tests on alternate days.</em></p><p><em>Before boarding the flight to London, every male and female member needs to carry six RT-PCR negative results.</em></p><p><em>"The BCCI has employed a central agency that is taking care of the RT-PCR tests for both men's and women's teams. Most players in big cities have had para medics visiting their respective homes to carry out the test.</em></p><p><em>"For those living in slightly remote areas, where our designated agency doesn't have a branch, the BCCI has asked the players (male and female) to get their tests done with cost to be reimbursed immediately," another senior official said.</em></p><p><em>Stand by pacer Prasidh Krishna and team's reserve wicketkeeper Wriddhiman Saha have both recovered from COVID-19 but the BCCI will allow them to spend some time at home and get rid of the weakness that is associated with the infection.</em></p><p><em>"Both Prasidh and Saha are allowed to join a bit late as they are recovering from COVID-19," a Board official said.</em></p><p><em>There was speculation that one national selector was pushing for Punjab middle-order batsman Mandeep Singh as a stand-by in case Prasidh doesn't get fit in time.</em></p><p><em>Mumbai's Suryakumar Yadav's name was also doing the rounds but there was no confirmation from BCCI about such a move, which cannot even be called a like-for-like replacement.</em></p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Motorola, Realme and Xiaomi to use Snapdragon 778G 5G mobile platform </title><link>https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/motorola-realme-and-xiaomi-to-use-snapdragon-778g-5g-mobile-platform</link><comments>https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/motorola-realme-and-xiaomi-to-use-snapdragon-778g-5g-mobile-platform#comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">d1c3f4c1-2adf-43c8-9c67-5c1161620561</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 17:11:28 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2021-05-19T17:11:28.968Z</atom:updated><atom:author><atom:name>PTI</atom:name><atom:uri>/api/author/623873</atom:uri></atom:author><description></description><media:keywords>Xiaomi,Motorola,Realme,Snapdragon 778G 5G mobile</media:keywords><media:content height="540" url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/0c362656-34c2-4bda-ae5f-7dff0c03db9e/processor_4987614_960_720.jpg" width="960"><media:title type="html"><![CDATA[ Motorola, Realme and Xiaomi to use Snapdragon 778G 5G mobile platform ]]></media:title></media:content><media:thumbnail url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/0c362656-34c2-4bda-ae5f-7dff0c03db9e/processor_4987614_960_720.jpg?w=280" width="280"></media:thumbnail><category>Business</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Mobile chipset company Qualcomm on Wednesday announced its new Snapdragon 778G 5G Mobile Platform that is slated to be used by smartphone vendors like Motorola, Realme and Xiaomi.</p><p>The Snapdragon 778G is designed to deliver cutting-edge mobile gaming and accelerated artificial intelligence (AI) to enable stunning photo and video experiences on smartphones.

</figure><p>Taking precautions for the cyclone on Monday, Gaikwad completed all his visits to patients till 10am. But at 4 pm he again left for Kaushalya hospital to make a decision for surgery of a patient. </p><p>"After attending the patients, I decided to move towards Horizon and Godbole hospital. I took the Hariniwas circle road and entered the Naupada police station road. I noticed a tree fall ahead, the road was turned to one way leading with slow moving traffic. I was moving at a speed of 10 to 20 kmph. I was about to reach the accident spot, when a small branch fell on the road, then again another fell ahead of my car. Even before I could react within seconds the huge tree collapsed on my car," added Gaikwad who panicked as the tree fell on the roof of the car and the car pressed him in. </p><p>"My shoulder and head were hit by the heavy fall and I was stuck. A woman police constable standing nearby came running. She first asked if anyone was in the car. I press the honk giving my presence in the car. Suddenly a few police officers from the nearby Naupada police station and the locals gathered at the spot. They advised me to keep patience and asked me to remove my head and shoulder, as I was stuck inside. They tried to move the tree but it was too huge,"added Gaikwad, stating the police then called the fire brigade and disaster management cell officials who reached in 15 to 20 mins. </p><p>Gaikwad claims the fire and disaster management cell officials started the operation to rescue me. "Even during a pandemic time the locals help in arranging power supply for cutting of the tree. It was complete teamwork. I was patiently sitting and a fire official was standing aside asking if there were any issues. They first kept stone below at the corner of the tree so that it didn't fall completely. They then kept cutting the tree. Instead of panicking, I asked them to carry out the operation slowly, as I was comfortably sitting inside. Almost after 90 minutes they rescued me safely," added Gaikwad who was overwhelmed after people started clapping after he came out safely. </p><p>Gaikwad claims in such a situation they should have used a crane to pull up the tree rather than cutting the tree for hours. "Just like during a surgery, where we ask the patient to keep patience. I too felt like a surgery carried out by the officials saved me," he added saying almost around 6 pm he was rescued and at 4:30 pm the tree had collapsed on his car.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>EPL: Players give fans their due; As Blues leapfrog Leicester and leave their top-four prospects in their own hands as fans are back in stadium</title><link>https://www.freepressjournal.in/sports/epl-players-give-fans-their-due-as-blues-leapfrog-leicester-and-leave-their-top-four-prospects-in-their-own-hands-as-fans-are-back-in-stadium</link><comments>https://www.freepressjournal.in/sports/epl-players-give-fans-their-due-as-blues-leapfrog-leicester-and-leave-their-top-four-prospects-in-their-own-hands-as-fans-are-back-in-stadium#comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">8b2b2e5e-b1bb-4c2d-8fb8-0d4c5da8026f</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 16:55:56 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2021-05-19T16:55:56.324Z</atom:updated><atom:author><atom:name>FPJ News Service</atom:name><atom:uri>/api/author/623884</atom:uri></atom:author><description></description><media:keywords>Chelsea,EPL,Leicester City</media:keywords><media:content height="1940" url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/4ad00540-e5c1-4839-afe6-1829d257bf86/19Chelsea.jpg" width="2763"><media:title type="html"><![CDATA[ Chelsea&apos;s German head coach Thomas Tuchel (L) applauds the fans following after their 2-1 win over Leicester City at the English Premier League football, Stamford Bridge in London on Wednesday.]]></media:title></media:content><media:thumbnail url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/4ad00540-e5c1-4839-afe6-1829d257bf86/19Chelsea.jpg?w=280" width="280"></media:thumbnail><category>Sports</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><em>London: Two second half goals one each by Antonio Rudiger and Jorginho assured Chelsea to topple Leicester City 2-1 victory and a places behind the first two in the Premier League.</em></p><p><em>At the Stamford Bridge, here on late Wednesday night (IST), even though Super Frankie Lampard wasn't completely forgotten in the repertoire of songs, the stadium was finally able to serenade Thomas Tuchel and found so much to be appreciative of.</em></p><p><em>A year-long wait finally saw 8,000 Chelsea fans make the most of it as they dislodged Leicester from third place heading into the Premier League finale.</em></p><p><em>The fans saw why Chelsea, ruthlessly perhaps, fired Lampard in January and replaced the club legend with Tuchel.</em></p><p><em>"It was amazing and exactly what we want.

"We found that Jondhale had supplied the explosive illegally to Mhatre. So he was arrested on Tuesday night. He was produced in court on Wednesday and remanded to police custody till May 22," said Krishna Kokani, senior police inspector, Thane crime branch unit 1. </p><p>The police during investigation found Jondhale is a license holder for purchasing the explosive. He had purchased the explosive from Solar Industries in Nagpur and Deccan Power company in Pune. "Jondhale was authorized to use the explosive at his quarry or road project. But instead he supplied it to Mhatre illegally. Mhatre was not a license holder and had no permission for keeping the explosive. On primary investigation it is found that the supply was made on May 16. We are further checking how many times in the past he had supplied the explosive to Mhatre or any other dealers. What was the reason for supplying such a huge quantity? Also, whether the quantity of explosive Jondhale brought was permitted for a license holder. We are checking if he had any illegal deal with the officials from the firm. As every supply from the firm is recorded in the register," said a police officer. </p><p>The police on Monday raided the office and store room of Gurunath Kashinath Mhatre, 53, at his office in Mittal Enterprise at Kharivali village. The team found gelatin sticks and detonators in huge quantities, worth ₹2.02 lakh. They were stored in boxes containing the names of licenced firms.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Violation of market norms: Sebi fines Biocon, its designated person Rs 14 lakh</title><link>https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/violation-of-market-norms-sebi-fines-biocon-its-designated-person-rs-14-lakh</link><comments>https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/violation-of-market-norms-sebi-fines-biocon-its-designated-person-rs-14-lakh#comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">7b7ace2c-10e1-4bf8-8081-69bc7eaa50d6</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 16:53:36 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2021-05-19T16:53:36.279Z</atom:updated><atom:author><atom:name>Agencies</atom:name><atom:uri>/api/author/623878</atom:uri></atom:author><description></description><media:keywords>SEBI,Biocon</media:keywords><media:content height="382" url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2020-01/6883d269-5f98-408c-9b77-d8d4cce48791/Sebi.jpg" width="679"><media:title type="html"><![CDATA[ Sebi fines Biocon, its designated person for violating market norms]]></media:title></media:content><media:thumbnail url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2020-01/6883d269-5f98-408c-9b77-d8d4cce48791/Sebi.jpg?w=280" width="280"></media:thumbnail><category>Business</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Markets regulator Sebi on Wednesday imposed a total fine of Rs 14 lakh on Biocon Ltd and its designated person for violation of market norms.</p><p>Designated person of the firm, Narendra Chirmule, who was employed with the company as senior vice president-R&amp;D is facing a fine of Rs 5 lakh for trading in the company's securities when the trading window was closed.</p><p>By doing so, he violated provisions of Prohibition of Insider Trading (PIT) norms.</p><p>Sebi noted that the trading window was closed by the compliance officer of Biocon from January 1-26, 2019 on account of declaration of quarterly financial results of the company for the quarter ended December 31, 2018, which were announced on January 24, 2019.</p><p>In accordance with market norms, the company has to notify the particulars of the trading details of the promoter / member of the promoter group /designated person /director, if the value of the securities traded is in excess of Rs 10 lakh, to the stock exchange within 2 trading days of receipt of the disclosure or from becoming aware of such information.</p><p>However, Biocon had informed the bourses after a delay of 262 days.</p><p>In addition, market norms require that violation of code of conduct (CoC) be informed to the regulator "promptly."

Extensive artificial insemination coverage and capacity to produce semen by milk unions will also help in faster dissemination of good genetics to farmers.</p><p>As per the agreement, NDDB, GCMMF and Milk Unions will work together to develop standard operating protocols (SOPs) for recording, taking up data analysis and monitoring the quality of data collected.</p><p>Around 1.9 lakh animals will be recorded in the next five years for their milk production capacity, fat, solids nor fat (SNF) and protein content of milk, reproduction regularity of animals, disease incidence, animal's body type, animal's behaviour, etc.</p><p>Out of the recorded animals, more than 80,000 animals will be genotyped and related data will help in genomic breeding value estimation with more accuracy.</p><p>This programme will include important breeds like Gir, Kankrej, and crossbred cows and Mehsana, Jaffarabadi, Murrah buffaloes. It is envisaged that all the bulls that enter Gujarat's semen stations will be genomically selected ensuring genetic merit.</p><p>According to NDDB, the project will fast-track genetic progress in cattle and buffaloes not only for their milk production potential but also for regular reproduction, reduced disease incidences and improved appearance. Apart from semen stations, farmers will also be able to use genomics for selection of heifers.</p><p>Besides central government funding through NDDB, GCMMF and Milk Unions will also invest in performance recording, genotyping and training of manpower for this programme, it added.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Mandsaur: Staff of District Coop Bank donates Rs 20L for kin of corona patients</title><link>https://www.freepressjournal.in/indore/mandsaur-staff-of-district-coop-bank-donates-rs-20l-for-kin-of-corona-patients</link><comments>https://www.freepressjournal.in/indore/mandsaur-staff-of-district-coop-bank-donates-rs-20l-for-kin-of-corona-patients#comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">f45a8762-ca3d-4884-b229-770b9f564d39</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 16:48:37 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2021-05-19T16:48:37.917Z</atom:updated><atom:author><atom:name>FP News Service</atom:name><atom:uri>/api/author/691555</atom:uri></atom:author><description></description><media:keywords>Staff of district coop bank,mandsaur coop bank</media:keywords><media:content height="293" url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/5da914da-93de-45c3-9e6f-9fa352149ebe/19_May___Mandsaur___Donation.jpg" width="520"><media:title type="html"></media:title></media:content><media:thumbnail url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/5da914da-93de-45c3-9e6f-9fa352149ebe/19_May___Mandsaur___Donation.jpg?w=280" width="280"></media:thumbnail><category>Indore</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><strong>Mandsaur (Madhya Prades):</strong> Staff of District Co-operative Bank Mandsaur donated Rs 20 lakh to the Redcross Society for providing financial aid to the kin of corona patients. </p><p>Under the guidance of collector Manoj Pushp and Covid Nodal Officer Rishabh Gupta, the bank donated Rs 12 lakh to Red Cross Society, Mandsaur and Rs 8 lakh to Red Cross Society, Neemuch. </p><p>Bank Administrator Bharat Singh Chouhan and CEO Parmanand Yadav said that the Red Cross Society will provide free medical kits and treatment to the corona patients.

Eight chawl buildings are of Arun Gawli and remaining two chawl buildings also purchased by Gawli's family. Soon no-objection certificate (NOC) to begin the redevelopment work will be issued to the selected builder.  While already letter of intent (LOI) has been granted to the tenants.  However, prior to that annexure list of eligible tenants will be made by the MBRRB." </p><p>As per the initial plan, 40 storeyed two towers will come up, which will have houses for original tenants and remaining for saleble components. In Dagdi Chawl, there are total 388 tenants and Gawli is the landlord of the property, who have sent the redevelopment proposal, which has been approved by MHADA after finding the property titleship documents valid. "Now, how many houses MBRRB of MHADA will obtain in the said project is yet to be ascertained. The LOI is just a first step, the plan may have certain revisions in later stage," asserted Ghosalkar.</p><p>Also Read: <a href="https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/maharashtra-government-provided-100-mhada-flats-to-tata-memorial-centre">Maharashtra government provided 100 MHADA flats to Tata Memorial Centre</a></p><p>Of 10 building comprising 4 storeyed each, 2 buildings already have been demolished by the MBRRB after it was declared extremely dangerous few years back.

Such restriction is not applicable even in other debt instruments such as municipal debt securities and securitised debt instruments.</p><p>Also, it has been suggested to do away with the requirement of minimum tenure of three years for public issue of NCRPS, as it restricts the flexibility of the issuers to structure their issuance as per their resource requirement and raise funds.</p><p>Sebi has suggested removal of restriction of four issuances in a year through a single shelf prospectus.</p><p>The ILDS Regulations provide that not more than four issuances can be made under a single shelf prospectus while there is no such restriction under the Companies Act.</p><p>In order to maintain consistency, it has been proposed that the validity of shelf placement memorandum be revised to one year. The shelf prospectus in case of public issue is valid till one year, whereas the shelf placement memorandum issued in case of private placement is valid for 180 days.</p><p>It has been proposed to allow issuers to file shelf prospectus provided they have cured the default atleast 30 days prior to filing the draft shelf prospectus.</p><p>Sebi has proposed that the requirement of minimum size, presently applicable only for debt securities should be removed. Also, it has recommended to replace distributable profit with operating profit.</p><p>It has been suggested that the electronic book platform should be mandatory for issuance of eligible securities proposed to be listed amounting to Rs 100 crore or above in a fnancial year.</p><p>In addition, it has been proposed that if the promoter, director, promoter group or the issuer has been debarred, then such issuer should not be allowed to list non-convertible securities issued on private placement basis.</p><p>Also, it has been suggested that in case issuer fails to make payment of dividend, then such issuer should not be allowed to make a public issue of NCRPS, till such time the default in payment of dividend is cure.</p><p>As per present NCRPS rules, the issuer who has defaulted in payment of interest will not be allowed to make public issue. However, in case issuer has defaulted in payment of dividend, then such issuer are allowed to make public issue of NCRPS.</p><p>Further, Sebi has proposed to mandate the appointment of a debenture trustee even for private placements of debt securities.</p><p>The regulator has suggested inclusion of restriction on fugitive economic offenders from accessing the securities markets in the NCS framework. However, ILDS and NCRPS Regulations do not contain such restriction.</p><p>In  addition, the regulator has proposed to insert several definitions including green debt securities in the NCS framework, which are not present in the ILDS and NCRPS Regulations.</p><p>The rules on ILDS and NCRPS were notified in June 2008 and June 2013, respectively. The ILDS Regulations were enacted for the issuance and listing of debt securities, whereas NCRPS Regulations was enacted for the issuance and listing of non-convertible redeemable preference shares.</p><p>Subsequent to the implementation of the these two rules, considerable time has passed, Sebi said.</p><p>In addition, various changes have taken place in the regulatory landscape, such as amendments to the Companies Act, repeal of the Sebi (Issue of Capital and Disclosure Requirements) Regulations, 2009, and substitution with ICDR rule, 2018, Sebi noted.</p><p>They also include enhancement of requirements for debenture trustees, and issue of various circulars in relation to the ILDS and NCRPS rules keeping in mind the market dynamics, it added.</p><p>The current NCRPS rules also cover the listing of perpetual debt instruments (PDIs) and perpetual non-convertible preference shares (PNCPS).</p><p>While debt securities are 'pure play' debt instruments, NCRPS' are hybrid equity and debt instruments. They carry a fixed dividend rate as well as are redeemable, and the holder is entitled to voting rights in case dividend is not paid for two years as per the Companies Act and therefore, they are also termed as a 'quasi-debt' instruments.</p><p>The NCRPS Regulations have been modelled on the ILDS Regulations.</p><p>The regulator said a need was felt to merge and realign the ILDS and NCRPS regulations to ensure that ease of reference and language and also remove redundancies.</p><p>The proposal will simplify and align the regulations in line with the various circulars and guidance issued by Sebi and improve the structure of the regulations in order to enhance readability, the regulator said.</p><p>The proposed merger is aimed at identifying policy changes in line with the present market practices and the prevailing regulatory environment and to ease doing business, it added.</p><p>In addition, it will separate the chapters on the basis of type of issuance -- public or private placement -- and instruments -- debt securities, commercial papers, so that all relevant information is sorted and are available at one place.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cryptocurrency market crashes: Know why Bitcoin slumped from $43,800 to almost $30,200; Dogecoin, Ethereum, Cardano join the dip</title><link>https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/cryptocurrency-market-crashes-know-why-bitcoin-slumped-from-43800-to-almost-30200-dogecoin-ethereum-cardano-join-the-dip</link><comments>https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/cryptocurrency-market-crashes-know-why-bitcoin-slumped-from-43800-to-almost-30200-dogecoin-ethereum-cardano-join-the-dip#comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">83688b0c-71cd-4286-a35d-6f7601772f07</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 16:32:16 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2021-05-19T16:32:16.691Z</atom:updated><atom:author><atom:name>FPJ Web Desk</atom:name><atom:uri>/api/author/623874</atom:uri></atom:author><description></description><media:keywords>Bitcoin,crashes,Dogecoin,Ethereum,Cardano,Cryptocurrency market</media:keywords><media:content height="1271" url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2020-12/cac7c427-1b97-4b63-9379-07bb1b434a88/cryptocurrency.jpg" width="1920"><media:title type="html"><![CDATA[ Cryptocurrency market crashes: Know why Bitcoin slumped from $43,800 to almost $30,200; Dogecoin, Ethereum, Cardano join the dip

The HC said the distribution shouldn't be on the basis of percentage of operational beds. </p><p>"We are told that the distribution formula devised by you (state) is presently based on the number of beds in use. This cannot be accepted," the bench told Akshay Shinde, the counsel appearing for the state. </p><p>"We clarified earlier as well that we don't want kin of patients running from pillar to post for anything. Thus, you must devise a formula wherein this drug is distributed based on the number of critical patients a hospital has," Chief Justice Datta said while ordering the state authorities to submit a proper affidavit on the next date of hearing along with the actual number of critical patients in the state. </p><p>The bench further noted that the oxygen requirement of the state has increased from 1,700 MT last week to 1,780 MT this week. It further took into account the fact that last week there were around 78,000 patients on oxygen supply while this week the numbers have gone down to 72,000.</p><p>"You (state) needed 1,500 MT when there were some seven lakh odd cases but today you have some four lakh cases and yet your demand has increased to 1,780 MT. We are unable to understand how you need more oxygen despite there been a decline in number of cases," CJ Datta said.  </p><p>The bench further noted from the note submitted by Shinde that there has been an indiscriminate use of Remdesivir in private hospitals. </p><p>"On what grounds are you making these allegation? Do you have any document to substantiate your claims?" the chief justice sought to know. </p><p>The query received no response to which CJ Datta said, "Either submit some proper documentary evidence to back your statements or do not make such allegations against private hospitals. You must have at least the data of daily requirements of private hospitals and the supply by the nodal officer."</p><p>The judges accordingly suggested the state to rope in the association of hospitals etc to co-ordinate the distribution of Remdesivir in all private hospitals.</p><p>The judges further told the state to consider taking help from the technical experts from the railways to develop your dashboard in a way that it gives real time update on availability of beds.</p><p>While expressing dissatisfaction over the short note the state had filed on Wednesday the judges ordered the state government to file a proper detailed affidavit on the next date of hearing that would be on Tuesday.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Madhya Pradesh: Work of ICU at Covid Centre inspected in Nagda

Of the Rs 1.75 lakh crore, Rs 1 lakh crore is to come from selling government stake in public sector banks and financial institutions. Rs 75,000 crore would come as CPSE disinvestment receipts.</p><p>In her Budget speech, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman said strategic disinvestment of BPCL, Air India, Shipping Corporation of India, Container Corporation of India, IDBI Bank, BEML, Pawan Hans, Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd, among others, and IPO of LIC would be completed in 2021-22.</p><p>The process of privatisation of Air India, BPCL, Pawan Hans, BEML, Shipping Corp (SCI), Neelachal Ispat Nigam Ltd, and Ferro Scrap Nigam Ltd (FSNL) is ongoing.</p><p>The sources said privatisation of these PSUs will be completed this fiscal ending March 2022.</p><p>They said Air India privatisation is on track despite Cairn Energy's lawsuit to get Air India recognised as the alter ego of India and that "it should be held jointly and severally responsible for India's debts, including from any judgment resulting from recognition of the award".</p><p>Once a court recognises Air India as the alter ego of the Indian government, Cairn can seek attachment or seizure of its assets in the US such as airplanes, immovable assets and bank accounts to recover the amount it was awarded by the arbitration tribunal.</p><p>"India is defending itself in the tax case. The Air India privatisation is on track and will not be impacted," a source said.</p><p>Air India, which was earlier this week served the lawsuit filed by Cairn in a New York court, will challenge it being made liable for the discharge of any payment obligations of the Government of India.</p><p>Even if Cairn succeeds in getting Air India recognised as alter ego of the government, it would not mean that the airline's assets will fall into the hands of the British firm, the sources said.</p><p>All it means is that Cairn can seek the seizure of any asset Air India may have in the US. There may not be many such assets.</p><p>The only threat there could be that when an Air India airplane lands at any US airport, Cairn is able to move court and get that attached before it flies out, they said.</p><p>The international arbitration tribunal had in December last year overturned the Indian government's Rs 10,247 crore tax demand from Cairn and ordered New Delhi to return the value of shares it had sold, dividends seized and tax refunds withheld.</p><p>Salt-to-software conglomerate Tata Group was among the "multiple" entities that had put in preliminary bids for buying loss-making Air India in December last year.</p><p>For BPCL privatisation, mining-to-oil conglomerate Vedanta had put in an expression of interest (EoI) for buying the government's 52.98 per cent stake in the PSU. The other two bidders are said to be global funds, one of them being Apollo Global Management.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cyclone Tauktae: High-level panel to enquire into barges stranding in Arabian Sea</title><link>https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/cyclone-tauktae-high-level-panel-to-enquire-into-barges-stranding-in-arabian-sea</link><comments>https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/cyclone-tauktae-high-level-panel-to-enquire-into-barges-stranding-in-arabian-sea#comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">2d32cf06-51c3-48a8-a889-eb93107e08a6</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 15:43:24 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2021-05-19T15:43:25.904Z</atom:updated><atom:author><atom:name>PTI</atom:name><atom:uri>/api/author/623873</atom:uri></atom:author><description></description><media:keywords>Arabian Sea,Cyclone Tauktae</media:keywords><media:content height="3246" url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/04aaf085-be29-4298-b16b-fc66ac359ab6/1905_pti05_19_2021_000056b.jpg" width="4800"><media:title type="html"><![CDATA[ Mumbai: INS Kochi arrives at Mumbai Naval Dockyard with the rescued crew members of barge P305, in Mumbai, Wednesday, May 19, 2021. ]]></media:title></media:content><media:thumbnail url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/04aaf085-be29-4298-b16b-fc66ac359ab6/1905_pti05_19_2021_000056b.jpg?w=280" width="280"></media:thumbnail><category>Mumbai</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p><strong>New Delhi:</strong> The oil ministry on Wednesday constituted a high-level committee to enquire into the sequence of events leading to the stranding of three vessels of a contractor of ONGC in cyclone 'Tauktae'.</p><p>Three barges of Afcons, a contractor working on ONGC fields off the west coast with more than 600 people on board, were stranded in offshore areas during the severe cyclone.</p><p>"The stranding, drifting and subsequent events have led to loss of several lives," a ministry statement said without giving details.</p><p>Also Read: <a href="https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/as-cyclone-tauktae-leaves-at-least-22-dead-on-barge-p305-maharashtra-minister-nawab-malik-says-ministry-of-petroleum-and-natural-gas-answerable">As Cyclone Tauktae leaves at least 22 dead on barge P305, Maharashtra minister Nawab Malik says 'Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas answerable'</a></p> <p>A committee comprising Amitabh Kumar, Director General of Shipping; SCL Das, Director General of Hydrocarbons, and Nazli Jafri Shayin, Joint Secretary, Ministry of Defence has been constituted to enquire into the incidents.</p><p>The panel may co-opt any other member, and take assistance of any person it deems necessary.</p><p>"The committee shall submit its report within one month," it said.</p><p>It has been asked to "inquire into the sequence of events leading to the stranding and drifting of these vessels, and subsequent events.?"

In a plea, Hazare sought the transfer of protest petitions in the Maharashtra State Cooperative Bank (MSCB) scam case to another court  fearing bias by the present judge.</p><p>The EOW had filed a joint reply for Hazare, former MP Shalinitai Patil and another individual, all of whom had sought that the protest petitions be transferred due to the same apprehension.</p><p>“With utmost humility and seriousness it is submitted that the applications contain comments on the Hon’ble Judge...which are contemptuous in nature and this Hon’ble court must deal with it with heavy hands so that no one ventures to attempt to lower the esteem of the judiciary..” the reply said. </p><p>Rather than the court being biased, it is the approach of the applicants that is biased, the EOW stated, adding that they view everything with “jaundiced eyes”. This, it pointed out, is due to the sequence of events wherein their advocate Satish Talekar, who used to earlier represent the original informant Surinder Arora, was discharged from services by Arora.</p><p>The EOW stated further that only Arora, being the original complainant who lodged the FIR, is legally entitled to file a protest petition. It pointed out that he has not sought a transfer of the proceedings and has concluded his arguments before the other court. Arora had recently filed an intervention in the present proceedings and said that he has no grievance against the judge handling his protest petition.</p><p>In another development, on Wednesday, the principal judge said it is ‘not desirable’ for the trial court to proceed urgently on Arora’s protest petition that was scheduled to be heard the next day, till the next date. It considered that pleas for stay on proceedings by Hazare, Patil and two other protest petitioners are pending before it. While the court did not order a stay, it said that it is a settled principle that whenever transfer petitions are filed before the principal judge, the trial court has to be slow in proceeding with the matter and not pass any orders that will frustrate these pending pleas.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Results: 100% of students passed 10th Board exams without appearing for exams in Chhattisgarh</title><link>https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/results-100-of-students-passed-10th-board-exams-without-appearing-for-exams-in-chhattisgarh</link><comments>https://www.freepressjournal.in/india/results-100-of-students-passed-10th-board-exams-without-appearing-for-exams-in-chhattisgarh#comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">57cede05-9a39-4056-ad4c-8500b9e55ea8</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 15:09:16 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2021-05-19T15:09:16.855Z</atom:updated><atom:author><atom:name>AVDHESH MALLICK</atom:name><atom:uri>/api/author/1524472</atom:uri></atom:author><description></description><media:keywords>exams,Chhattisgarh,pass out</media:keywords><media:content height="353" url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/451a7116-f758-4e8f-9024-8f5d29c40426/cgbse1.jpeg" width="471"><media:title type="html"><![CDATA[ 100% students passed 10th Board exams without appearing for exams in Chhattisgarh]]></media:title></media:content><media:thumbnail url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/451a7116-f758-4e8f-9024-8f5d29c40426/cgbse1.jpeg?w=280" width="280"></media:thumbnail><category>India</category><category>Topnews</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Amid Covid 19 pandemic, Chhattisgarh's 10<sup>th</sup> Board Exam results were announced with 100 percent pass percentage.

"A historic decision was taken to increase the subsidy for DAP fertiliser from Rs 500 per bag to Rs 1,200 per bag, which is an increase of 140 per cent. Thus, despite the rise in international market prices of DAP, it has been decided to continue selling it at the older price of Rs 1,200 and the Central government has decided to bear all the burden of the price hike. The amount of subsidy per bag has never been increased so much at once," read an official release.</p><p>"Last year, the actual price of DAP was Rs 1,700 per bag. In which the Central government was giving a subsidy of Rs 500 per bag. So the companies were selling fertiliser to farmers for Rs 1200 per bag," it added.

The HC said other municipal corporations in the state must follow the vision of the BMC. </p><p>The bench was seized with a bunch of PILs highlighting the Covid crisis in Maharashtra and Mumbai. </p><p>On Wednesday when the matter came up for hearing senior counsel Anil Sakhare for the BMC submitted a short affidavit before the judges. </p><p>The bench noted that there has been a reduction in active as well as daily cases in the city. </p><p>"On Tuesday we recorded around 954 cases, we have come down from 1000 plus cases now," Sakhare submitted. </p><p>At this, the judges noted that with less cases, there have been more beds lying vacant in the civic run hospitals. </p><p>"Can't these beds and facilities made available for people from adjoining cities/districts?" Justice Kulkarni questioned. </p><p>At this, Sakhare responded, "We are already providing such facilities. We arent asking people as to from which city or state they are coming from? We are only giving them the requisite treatment."</p><p>"We are now gearing up for the third wave to ensure that children are provided better facilities," the senior counsel added. </p><p>Having heard the submissions, Justice Kulkarni told advocate Abhijit Kulkarni, appearing for the Pune Municipal Corporation (PMC) to learn from the BMC. </p><p>"See the extraordinary vision and pattern of the BMC. There are so many hospitals and medical colleges run by the BMC in Mumbai and every one of them has a bed capacity of about 1000 to 2000 beds.

And that is the reason BMC controlled this pandemic and is still dealing with it properly," the judge added. </p><p>The bench further noted that just like BMC no other civic bodies in the state have multiple hospitals-cum-medical colleges.  </p><p>"In some corporations there is not a single such hospital cum medical college. And the ones, who have such facilities, the public health has taken a back seat," CJ Datta pointed.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Sebi imposes Rs 5.25 crore fine on Cairn India in share buyback case </title><link>https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/sebi-imposes-rs-525-crore-fine-on-cairn-india-in-share-buyback-case</link><comments>https://www.freepressjournal.in/business/sebi-imposes-rs-525-crore-fine-on-cairn-india-in-share-buyback-case#comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">599e7345-df0e-4ef8-91cf-589644abb73b</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 14:55:52 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2021-05-19T14:55:52.382Z</atom:updated><atom:author><atom:name>PTI</atom:name><atom:uri>/api/author/623873</atom:uri></atom:author><description></description><media:keywords>SEBI,share buyback,fine,Cairn India</media:keywords><media:content height="749" url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2020-08/5b24455d-e5b4-4417-9d18-11da66a3c187/SEBI.jpg" width="1200"><media:title type="html"><![CDATA[ SEBI]]></media:title></media:content><media:thumbnail url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2020-08/5b24455d-e5b4-4417-9d18-11da66a3c187/SEBI.jpg?w=280" width="280"></media:thumbnail><category>Business</category><category>Topnews</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Markets regulator Sebi on Wednesday imposed a penalty of Rs 5.25 crore on Cairn India for making a misleading announcement regarding the buyback of shares in 2014.</p><p>In addition, the regulator levied a fine of Rs 15 lakh each on P Elango, who was the CEO and director of Cairn, Aman Mehta, who was the director on the company's board, and Neerja Sharma, who was director (risk assurance) and company secretary, Sebi said in an order.</p><p>These three officials had signed the public advertisement regarding the buyback in January 2014 and facilitated the company in making the misleading announcement.</p><p>After a detailed investigation, Sebi found that Cairn did not place adequate buy orders despite the availability of adequate sell orders at NSE.</p><p>It further noted that Cairn was not able to fulfil at least 50 per cent of the buyback issue, despite the conditions were favourable to the company.</p><p>"...

This has led to the need of owning a house in their native countries. </p><p>With a weaker rupee and lower interest rates for housing loans there has been a surge in NRI investment in real estate sector according to the data available with NoBrokers.com.</p><p>To understand the trend of NRI home buying activity amid Pandemic, NoBroker.com surveyed 700 NRIs using phone and email interaction. Through this survey it observed that the NRI’s prefer larger homes in integrated townships, which offer lifestyle features similar to what they have experienced while being expatriates in a foreign country. </p><p>This populace is either investing in ready-to-move properties which reduce the construction risk. The survey data shows 40 per cent growth in interest in gated community in past one year in Mumbai city. As gated communities offer more security, ease of living. Nowadays, due to the pandemic that has spread, safety is paramount and gated communities are more in demand not just by NRIs but even by non-NRIs.</p><p>Amit Agarwal, Co-Founder &amp; CEO, NoBroker said, "Ever since the first wave of the pandemic, we have observed an increase in interest from the NRI community. Initially, it was due to the safety aspect as India was one of least hit companies in the first wave and later also because the government announced many policies and measures that made home-buying more affordable. Weakening of the rupee added another shot in the arm for NRI buyers."</p><p>"Most NRI buyers are looking for a society accommodation due to the security and hassle-free living offered through society apps and also because these units are easy to rent out if end use is not the current priority. It is easier to do research on the project and the builder especially when one cannot physically visit to ascertain quality and credibility. Given the push by the government and the builders to revive the industry, this surge is estimated to continue throughout this year."</p><p>The NoBroker.com survey results further shows, in Mumbai, the preferred average ticket size ranges from 70-75 lakhs for 1BHKs; 1.2 to 1.8 Cr for 2BHKs and 2 Cr and upwards for properties with 3BHKs and more. Also, the platform has observed maximum demand from buyers in the USA.<br></p><p>An NRI homebuyer named Nigama Varshney says, "It was a great experience using NoBroker for buying property in Mumbai. Compared to rent, there are many more questions and doubts when the decision is about buying the property. The platform helped us make the decision. We wanted to buy a house in Mumbai since we plan to return to India a few years later. Property prices have stabilised now and hence we took the decision to go for a gated community with amenities for us and our kids."</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Bhumi Pednekar pens down emotional note on her father&apos;s birth anniversary; shares throwback picture</title><link>https://www.freepressjournal.in/entertainment/bollywood/bhumi-pednekar-pens-down-emotional-note-on-her-fathers-birth-anniversary-shares-throwback-picture</link><comments>https://www.freepressjournal.in/entertainment/bollywood/bhumi-pednekar-pens-down-emotional-note-on-her-fathers-birth-anniversary-shares-throwback-picture#comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">4f57be5a-1033-4353-906d-1ed6136ae435</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 14:37:00 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2021-05-19T14:37:02.145Z</atom:updated><atom:author><atom:name>ANI</atom:name><atom:uri>/api/author/623872</atom:uri></atom:author><description></description><media:keywords>Bhumi Pednekar,COVID-19</media:keywords><media:content height="620" url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/db4e601e-a7fc-4884-86a0-5e8d2cc6abc7/167030894_3816431138474918_6059440535417946688_n__1_.jpg" width="858"><media:title type="html"><![CDATA[ Bhumi Pednekar pens down emotional note on her father&apos;s birth anniversary; shares throwback picture]]></media:title></media:content><media:thumbnail url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/db4e601e-a7fc-4884-86a0-5e8d2cc6abc7/167030894_3816431138474918_6059440535417946688_n__1_.jpg?w=280" width="280"></media:thumbnail><category>Bollywood</category><category>Entertainment</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>Remembering her late father- Satish Pednekar on his birth anniversary, Bollywood actor Bhumi Pednekar shared her childhood throwback picture along with an emotional note on Wednesday.</p> <p>The 'Toilet-Ek Prem Katha' actor took to her Instagram and shared a throwback picture that features her childhood picture with her parents.</p> <p>Alongside the adorable picture, she wrote, "Happy birthday papa.

In addition, it stated economies like China, India and South Africa fared better than major economies.</p><p>The report pointed out that this is completely opposite to what was seen in 2015 and 2009 recession.  </p><p>It took 13 quarters for global trade to recover from the 2015 recession, "which resulted from structural changes in East Asian economies and declines in commodity prices, and nine quarters to bounce back from the 2009 recession caused by the global financial crisis", the report stated <strong>(check graph below).</strong></p><p>UNCTAD economist Alessandro Nicita said it took four quarters after the start of the pandemic-induced recession for world trade to return to pre-recession levels. By the fifth quarter – Q1 2021 – global trade was higher than pre-crisis levels, with an increase of about 3 per cent relative to Q4 2019.</p><figure><img src="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/50682d23-8251-4587-9251-891332195d9d/Screenshot_2021_05_19_193755.jpg" /></figure><p>“China, India and South Africa fared relatively better than other major economies during Q1 2021,” stated UNCTAD’s global trade update report. </p><p>The report stated China’s exports registered a strong increase not only from 2020 averages but also in relation to pre-pandemic levels. “In contrast, exports from Russia remained well below 2019 averages.”</p><p>It also stated that the overall trade continues to rebound more strongly for developing countries compared to developed countries. However, "the trade recovery for developing countries becomes much more muted when East Asian economies are excluded and disappears when only exports are considered".</p><p>According to the report, the rebound in Q1 2021 continued to be driven by East Asian economies. This was mainly driven by the early success these economics had while tackling the COVID-19 pandemic. This mitigation allowed them to rebound faster and to capitalise on booming global demand for COVID-19 related products.</p><p>In Q1 2021, the value of merchandise imports and exports of developing countries is substantially higher compared to Q1 2020 and also to Q1 2019 (by about 16 per cent).</p><p>“Global trade has recorded a faster recovery from the recession caused by the pandemic than in the last two trade recessions,” said Nicita, who worked on the report.</p><figure><img src="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/6d6a28aa-47fe-4f9a-8054-e64eaf9505ec/china.jpg" /></figure><p>The report says in Q1 2021 the value of trade in goods was higher than pre-pandemic level, but trade in services remains substantially below averages. “Global trade in COVID-19-related products remained strong during the quarter,” it says.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Hema Malini installs oxygen enhancer machines in Mathura to help tackle COVID-19 crisis</title><link>https://www.freepressjournal.in/entertainment/bollywood/hema-malini-installs-oxygen-enhancer-machines-in-mathura-to-help-tackle-covid-19-crisis</link><comments>https://www.freepressjournal.in/entertainment/bollywood/hema-malini-installs-oxygen-enhancer-machines-in-mathura-to-help-tackle-covid-19-crisis#comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">186882b3-6940-486a-bc71-9f4bf8c6dd4d</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 14:20:39 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2021-05-19T14:20:41.308Z</atom:updated><atom:author><atom:name>ANI</atom:name><atom:uri>/api/author/623872</atom:uri></atom:author><description></description><media:keywords>hema malini,Mathura,COVID-19 crisis</media:keywords><media:content height="520" url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2019-10/04d3568a-b8c2-47cf-b1ce-bd3403e1bbb6/sa3.jpg" width="760"><media:title type="html"><![CDATA[ Hema Malini installs oxygen enhancer machines in Mathura to help tackle COVID-19 crisis]]></media:title></media:content><media:thumbnail url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2019-10/04d3568a-b8c2-47cf-b1ce-bd3403e1bbb6/sa3.jpg?w=280" width="280"></media:thumbnail><category>Bollywood</category><category>Entertainment</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>The 'Dream Girl' of Bollywood- Hema Malini, on Wednesday installed oxygen enhancer machines in Mathura district to serve the Braj residents amid the ongoing COVID-19 health crisis.</p> <p>The veteran actor who serves as the Lok Sabha representative for the Mathura constituency took to Twitter handle to inform that she had installed 7 oxygen enhancer machines in Mathura to help Braj residents.</p> <p>Sharing further details, she wrote, "braj vaasiyon ki seva ke lie janpad mathura mein 7 oxygen enhancer machine sthaapit karva kar main apne aap ko dhanye mehasoos kar rahi hoon.

Mycormycosis was always there in those who are immunocompromised, diabetic, high steroid dose, but it was never in this number," Dr Padma, Head, Neurology Department, AIIMS, told ANI.</p><p>"She said that earlier the number was in single-digit. But, now we have crossed three-digit mark and are getting more than 20 cases of the infection every single day. We have made mucor wards separately at AIIMS Delhi, AIIMS Trauma Centre, and AIIMS Jhajjar," Dr Padma added.</p><p>She further informed that the index of suspicion of contracting Black Fungus is very high because of low immunity. If COVID happens to diabetic people, sugar should be strictly controlled and there should be rational use of steroids.</p><p>"Cases of mucormycosis began being reported two months ago and states like Gujarat and Maharashtra have, so far, reported more than 1,800 cases. Now, Delhi is also reporting a high number of cases and a maximum of those are the ones who have taken high doses of steroids or are diabetic," she added.</p><p>Max hospitals across India have reported 50 cases of black fungus, and in Delhi alone, the numbers are 25.</p><p>"COVID-19 strain may also be the reason and we need to do genome sequencing to understand this disease more," Dr Padma said.</p><p>Dr DS Rana, Chairperson, Sri Gangaram Hospital, informed that the hospital has as many as 48 admitted Black Fungus patients and 16 are in the waiting list.</p><p>The rare fungal infection called 'mucormycosis' or 'black fungus' is on the rise in several parts of the country, including Delhi.</p><p>As per the Union Health Ministry, Mucormycosis or black fungus is a complication caused by a fungal infection.</p><p>People catch mucormycosis by coming in contact with the fungal spores in the environment. It can also develop on the skin after the fungus enters the skin through a cut, scrape, burn, or other type of skin trauma. </p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>COVID-19: Mumbai reports 1,350 cases, 57 deaths on May 19</title><link>https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/covid-19-mumbai-reports-1350-cases-57-deaths-on-may-19</link><comments>https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/covid-19-mumbai-reports-1350-cases-57-deaths-on-may-19#comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">6dc6ef13-c712-4608-a29b-ff9b79ec76bd</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 14:17:57 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2021-05-19T14:17:57.378Z</atom:updated><atom:author><atom:name>FPJ Web Desk</atom:name><atom:uri>/api/author/623874</atom:uri></atom:author><description></description><media:keywords>Mumbai .,COVID-19</media:keywords><media:content height="2092" url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/3257df15-b2ab-4e09-9a5c-dffcd638a8d9/1305_20210513104942_india_health_virus_afp_99w428.jpg" width="3137"><media:title type="html"></media:title></media:content><media:thumbnail url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/3257df15-b2ab-4e09-9a5c-dffcd638a8d9/1305_20210513104942_india_health_virus_afp_99w428.jpg?w=280" width="280"></media:thumbnail><category>Mumbai</category><category>Topnews</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>With the addition of 1,350 new COVID-19 cases on May 19, Mumbai's infection tally rose to 6,92,239.

In Australia, the public sector loss according to the report was 200 per cent.</p><p>Even in South Africa, the only other emerging nation included in the study, the government suffered all income losses, while private sector income was broadly unchanged, the report said.</p><p>Within the private sector, while the fiscal support made up for more than lost household (disposable) income in Australia, Canada and the US, households in India and South Africa incurred 61-68 per cent of economic losses during the year.</p><p>The corporate sector suffered higher income losses in France and Spain to the tune of 30-35 per cent and gained massively in Australia and South Africa due to the fiscal support. The corporate sector in other nations, including India, saw moderate losses in the range of 12-16 per cent, while it was broadly balanced in Germany.</p><p>"This clearly reveals that due to extremely low fiscal support in India, the income losses for the private sector (especially households) were much higher compared to other major nations. And with India's private sector bearing such a large share of income losses, we are skeptical of a strong rebound in growth, as and when it happens," it said.</p><p>The report further noted that with the country reeling under a much more severe second wave of the pandemic, the major lesson for the government is to loosen its purse strings and support the household sector directly via income transfer/employment guarantee.</p><p>"Without a strong household sector, the Indian economy may find it difficult to achieve a strong revival on a durable basis in a post-pandemic era," it said.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Cyclone Tauktae: BJP leaders Devendra Fadnavis, Pravin Darekar visit affected areas of Raigad</title><link>https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/cyclone-tauktae-bjp-leaders-devendra-fadnavis-pravin-darekar-visit-affected-areas-of-raigad</link><comments>https://www.freepressjournal.in/mumbai/cyclone-tauktae-bjp-leaders-devendra-fadnavis-pravin-darekar-visit-affected-areas-of-raigad#comments</comments><guid isPermaLink="false">386f9c4f-f63b-4eca-9d8b-7fd7ab187043</guid><pubDate>Wed, 19 May 2021 14:06:05 +0000</pubDate><atom:updated>2021-05-19T14:06:05.765Z</atom:updated><atom:author><atom:name>Ravikiran Deshmukh</atom:name><atom:uri>/api/author/1545559</atom:uri></atom:author><description></description><media:keywords>BJP,Devendra Fadnavis,Raigad,Pravin Darekar,Tauktae</media:keywords><media:content height="506" url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/2f50221c-ebdf-4b4d-abe2-b3ff58e68033/dev_aiag.jpg" width="760"><media:title type="html"></media:title></media:content><media:thumbnail url="https://images.assettype.com/freepressjournal/2021-05/2f50221c-ebdf-4b4d-abe2-b3ff58e68033/dev_aiag.jpg?w=280" width="280"></media:thumbnail><category>Mumbai</category><category>Topnews</category><content:encoded><![CDATA[ <p>BJP leaders Devendra Fadnavis and Pravin Darekar, who are also leaders of opposition in the state assembly and state council respectively, visited cyclone Tauktae affected areas of Raigad.</p><p>Accompanied by local leaders from BJP, Fadnavis and Darekar began their three-day tour by visiting cyclone-hit areas of Raigad district such as Alibaug, Roha and Mahad and spoke with affected residents.

India has been dealing with crisis as many states have been crumbling for oxygen. As the demand for oxygen is on a rise, there had been myths around that an oxygen concentrator can be used at home in case of emergency, however the Central Government has put to rest the myth and clarified that oxygen concentrators are to be used with accurate guidance from a chest physician or an internal medicine specialist only as this can be potentially harmful. </p><p>Few weeks back, the Central government had bust the myth that drinking warm water or taking hot water bath doesn't help to prevent the COVID-19 virus. It revealed the fact that a temperature of 60 to 75 degree celcius is required in lab settings to kill the virus.</p><p>Owing to the crisis situation, so far, 12,874 oxygen concentrators, 15,801 oxygen cylinders and 19 oxygen generation plants have been delivered to states and union territories (UTs). Besides these, the government said 9,925 ventilators/ BiPAP, and approximately 6.1 lakh Remdesivir vials were also dispatched between April 27 and May 18 to the states and UTs. The government has been receiving international cooperation of COVID-19 relief medical supplies and equipment since April 27 from different countries/organisations.</p><figure><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Don’t fall for any kind of misinformation!

The boat owner Justin Diamond Miranda and five other fishermen were on-board. The stuck-up fishing vessel was in touch with the authorities through wireless communication. </p><p>After getting instructions from authorities, Justin and his crew members tried to manoeuvre the boat in the direction of the wind with an aim to take shelter at the Dahanu port, but that also turned out to be an impossible task. </p><p>“Moreover the GPS showed a 12-hour journey of around 34 km to reach the Dahanu port. Waiting for rescue that never came, we were left with no other option and somehow managed to anchor the boat at the same spot only after three anchors cracked and we were left with limited rope. Despite having food we were unable to cook and remained hungry for more than 36 hours. It was like a whirlwind attacking us from all different directions. At one point I had lost hope, but the Almighty saved us,” said Justin Miranda. </p><p>By Tuesday evening, when the weather had improved and the sea was much calmer, the partly damaged “New Help Mary” boat resumed its journey at 6:30 pm and slowly reached the Uttan coast at around 9:30 pm. </p><p>The villagers had gathered to give a rousing welcome to the fishermen. “The coast guard team, police and the district administration remained helpless as the choppy weather conditions and stormy winds made the rescue operations next to impossible,” said fishing community leader Bernard D’mello.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title>Dun &amp; Bradstreet India and BSE sign MOU to support MSME

This is to create an ecosystem for promoting, aiding and fostering the growth of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in the country. </p><p>This association will help SMEs in India to increase their visibility, expand access to global markets, find potential customers, uncover new suppliers and channel partners, manage risk and identify growth opportunities.</p><p>Speaking about the partnership, Avinash Gupta, Managing Director &amp; CEO – India, Dun &amp; Bradstreet said, “Dun &amp; Bradstreet has been engaged with Indian MSMEs since the past two decades, providing them with the necessary business intelligence to help them grow and thrive, even in challenging times. As countries are witnessing 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> waves of the pandemic amidst battling the deepest recession since the World War II, SMEs are the worst affected across countries, sectors and segments, and India is no exception. In India, more than 99 per cent of businesses belong to Micro, Small and Medium category and 94 per cent of them are unorganized."</p><p>Dun &amp; Bradstreet's recent survey conducted in the last quarter of 2020 reveals that the three topmost challenges that might impede SMEs to scale up their businesses are Market Access (42 per cent), Improving the Overall Productivity (37 per cent) and Having Access to More Finance (34 per cent). By working with BSE, we expect to play a pivotal role in enabling the eco-system required to accelerate SME growth and help achieve the government GDP contribution target of 50 per cent of GDP by FY 2025.”</p><p>Commenting on this collaboration, Ajay Thakur, Head-BSE SME &amp; Startups, said, “The current economic situation may propel more SMEs and Startups to avail of these services in order to further improve their businesses.
